  fhir:description [ fhir:v "Providers use this [operation](http://hl7.org/fhir/operations.html) to submit *solicited* and *unsolicited* attachments or additional information for claims or prior authorization. The $submit-attachment operation accepts the clinical/administrative attachments and the information required to associate them with the claim or prior authorization and returns an HTTP response. For *unsolicited* attachments, the Provider invokes this operation *before, concurrently, or after*  the claim or pre-authorization transaction. For *solicited* attachments, the Provider invokes it when responding to a Payer request for attachments or additional information. Any HTTP endpoint can use $submit-attachment, not just FHIR RESTful server endpoints. Implementers of CDex's *Unsolicited* Attachments **SHOULD** support the [Endpoint Discovery Strategy](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/STU1.1/endpoint-discovery.html) defined in the Da Vinci HRex specification to allow discovery of the endpoint for this operation. For *Solicited Attachments*, the $submit-attachment endpoint is supplied in the [CDex Task Attachment Request Profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-cdex/StructureDefinition/cdex-task-attachment-request)\n\nThe input parameters are:\n1. One or more attachments as FHIR Resources\n    - Optionally, one or more unique line item numbers associated with the attachment\n    - Optionally, the attachment code used to request the information\n1. Data elements for the association to the claim/prior authorization\n    - A unique identifier that ties the attachment(s) back to the claim or prior authorization. (referred to as the \"re-association tracking control numbers\")\n    - What are the attachments for:\n      - Claims\n      - Prior Authorizations\n    - Optionally, a unique payer identifier\n    - A unique organization/location identifier (e.g., [Type 2 NPI](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/NPI-What-You-Need-To-Know.pdf)) or unique provider identifier (e.g., [Type 1 NPI](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/NPI-What-You-Need-To-Know.pdf))\n    - A unique Patient member identifier\n    - A Date of Service\n    - A Flag indicating whether the operation is the last attachment submission for the claim or prior authorization.\n\nThere are no output parameters."] ; #
